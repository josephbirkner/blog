# Subject of Information

![me](me.jpg)

Hello there! My name is Joseph Birkner, but I also frequently go by *realitivity* (*Realitivit√§t*). While I'm a software engineer by profession, this site is more dedicated to the writings of mine that do not follow a declarative syntax.

## About

The name of this blog is "*Subject of Information*" (Deutsch: *Informationswesen*), because the phrase has a fun heteronymity to it:
 
1. It means "the topic of information".
2. It describes "a being made of information".

Consider the my blog posts as members of the former, written by one of the latter `:)`.
