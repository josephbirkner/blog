# Hello There! ![kenobi](./kenobi.png)

Welcome to my Blog, [Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.). I am a Programmer originally from Leipzig/Germany, now living wherever life takes me 🏙️. This place is dedicated to hosting whatever I feel I might want to share that does not fit into a <s>tweet</s> toot (somehow not much does 🤷‍♂️), and is not (syntactically strict) code. **Enjoy 🙌!**

## About

The phrase "*Subject of Information*" (*Informationswesen* in German) is a [heteronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics))!

Meaning, you can understand it as both *"the topic of information"* and *"a being made of information"*.

Consider my posts as members of the former, by one of the latter 🤔
